# Deep Stats

Deep Stats is a high performance, highly flexible stat and modifier authoring system for Unity. 

## Getting started
There are a few core concepts that should be understood to get the most out of this library, head over to [Overview](/docs/overview.md) to get started.

Alternatively if you just want to figure it out on your own, the bare minimum setup guide can be found in the [Quick Start](/docs/quickstart.md) guide.
